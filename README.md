## üß† How It Works

### Emotion Detection
The app uses DeepFace to analyze facial expressions and determine your dominant emotion from categories like happy, sad, angry, etc.

### Music Recommendation
The app maps emotions to musical qualities and searches Spotify for matching songs. If you choose to "shift your mood," it will recommend music with more positive emotional qualities.

### Music Generation
1. Creates a dynamic path of emotions starting from your detected state
2. Gradually transitions toward more positive emotional states
3. Generates musical segments for each emotion using MusicGen
4. Combines segments into a cohesive musical journey
5. Provides visualization tools to see the audio structure

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- Genre preferences for music recommendations
- Social sharing options
- Custom emotion transition paths
- Voice mood detection option
